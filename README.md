## Description-
   In this Project we aim to help newly admitted students in getting information regarding our college clubs at one place. Students can join clubs as per their interests and passion. This will help them to explore themselves as well as develop their softskills and expand their network.
   
   This project is developed in Java so it provides platform independence, high performance and security.
   
   It provides some enhanced features such as: clubs information at one place for students, an easy interface for admin to add, edit or remove clubs. We are mainly focusing on responsiveness, usability and performance of our website.
